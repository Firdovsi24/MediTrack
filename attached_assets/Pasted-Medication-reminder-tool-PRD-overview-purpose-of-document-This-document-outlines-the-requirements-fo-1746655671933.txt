Medication reminder tool PRD
overview
purpose of document
This document outlines the requirements for a medication reminder tool aimed at helping elderly users manage their prescriptions through AI-driven image recognition and reminders. It serves as a guide for the development team to build, test, and deliver a fully functional web-based application without server-side storage.

background
Elderly users often struggle to remember medication schedules. By allowing them to photograph medication bottles, the tool leverages AI to extract dosage and frequency information, automatically create reminders, and enable confirmation or snoozing, improving adherence and reducing errors.

objectives and success metrics
objectives
enable users to add medications via bottle photographs

automatically extract dosage and schedule with AI

provide timely reminders with snooze and confirmation options

track medication history and completion status

operate entirely in client-side state without a backend database

success metrics
medication entries added per user ≥ 1 with AI extraction accuracy ≥ 90%

reminder delivery success rate ≥ 99%

average user interaction time to confirm or snooze ≤ 10 seconds

user satisfaction score ≥ 4.5/5 in usability testing

zero critical bugs in production related to core flows

assumptions and constraints
assumptions
users have modern browsers supporting camera access and notifications

AI model runs client-side or via lightweight inference API

users prefer local data storage to cloud persistence

constraints
no backend database or cloud storage; all data resides in browser state (e.g., IndexedDB or localStorage)

must function offline after initial load

minimal external dependencies to reduce complexity

functional requirements
image capture and recognition
allow users to launch the device camera or upload an image

display captured image preview before submission

invoke AI module to recognize medication name, dosage amount, and frequency

schedule creation
generate a calendar entry based on extracted frequency (e.g., “take 1 pill every 8 hours”)

allow users to adjust suggested times before saving

reminders and notifications
send push notifications at scheduled times

notification must offer “Confirm” and “Snooze (10 min)” actions

if snoozed, reschedule the notification 10 minutes later

user actions
confirm intake to mark a dose as taken

view upcoming doses in a simple list or calendar view

snooze reminders up to three times per dose

edit or delete any medication entry

data storage
persist all medication entries, schedules, and statuses in browser storage

ensure data persists across page reloads and browser restarts

non-functional requirements
accessibility and usability
UI elements sized and labeled for low-vision users

support screen readers and high-contrast mode

performance
initial load time ≤ 3 seconds on 4G

AI inference ≤ 2 seconds per image

security
optional PIN lock to prevent unauthorized access to medication data

data stored locally must not be accessible to other web origins

compatibility
support latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on desktop and mobile

responsive design for various screen sizes

privacy
no personal health data sent to external servers

clear disclosure that data remains on device only

user stories and acceptance criteria
US-001
User story: As an elderly user, I want to take a picture of a medication bottle so that the tool can identify the medication and dosage schedule.
Acceptance criteria:

Given the camera is accessed, when I capture an image, then I see a preview.

When I submit the preview, then AI identifies medication name, dosage, and frequency with ≥ 90% accuracy.

US-002
User story: As an elderly user, I want the AI to suggest a schedule based on the recognized frequency so that I don’t have to enter times manually.
Acceptance criteria:

After recognition, the system displays suggested times (e.g., 8 AM, 4 PM, 12 AM).

I can edit any suggested time before saving.

US-003
User story: As an elderly user, I want to view my medication schedule in a calendar or list so that I can see upcoming doses.
Acceptance criteria:

When I navigate to the schedule view, then upcoming doses for today and tomorrow are listed chronologically.

US-004
User story: As an elderly user, I want to receive push notifications at scheduled times so that I’m reminded to take my medication.
Acceptance criteria:

Given a scheduled dose, when the reminder time arrives, then I receive a notification with “Confirm” and “Snooze (10 min)” buttons.

US-005
User story: As an elderly user, I want to snooze a reminder for 10 minutes so that I can delay taking my medication briefly.
Acceptance criteria:

When I tap “Snooze,” then the notification disappears and reappears exactly 10 minutes later.

US-006
User story: As an elderly user, I want to confirm that I’ve taken a dose so that the tool can track my adherence history.
Acceptance criteria:

When I tap “Confirm,” then the dose status updates to “taken,” and the next dose remains scheduled.

US-007
User story: As an elderly user, I want to view my intake history so that I can review which doses I’ve taken.
Acceptance criteria:

In the history view, each past dose appears with date, time, and status (taken or missed).

US-008
User story: As an elderly user, I want to edit or delete a medication entry so that I can correct mistakes or remove discontinued medicines.
Acceptance criteria:

When I choose “Edit,” I can modify name, dosage, or schedule and save changes.

When I choose “Delete,” I am prompted for confirmation before removal.

US-009
User story: As a user, I want all my data stored locally so that I don’t need an account or internet connection.
Acceptance criteria:

Upon entering data, it persists after page reloads and browser restarts without errors.

US-010
User story: As a user, I want to set an optional PIN so that only I can access my medication information.
Acceptance criteria:

I can enable PIN protection in settings, set a 4-digit code, and am prompted for it on each launch.

After three failed attempts, the app locks and resets PIN setup after a 5-minute delay.
