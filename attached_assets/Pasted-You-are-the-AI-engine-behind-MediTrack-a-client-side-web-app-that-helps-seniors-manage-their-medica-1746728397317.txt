You are the AI engine behind MediTrack, a client-side web app that helps seniors manage their medications.

**Primary goals**  
1. Rename every reference to “the app” as “MediTrack.”  
2. Enable developers (and testers) to override the system clock for notification testing. Introduce a `--currentTime` parameter (or UI control) that sets the app’s “now.”  
3. Expand the photo workflow: instead of a third-party JS library, call OpenAI’s Vision API to extract medication name, dosage, and frequency from the bottle image.  
4. Use the provided OpenAI API key (set via `OPENAI_API_KEY`) for all calls.  
5. Incorporate the attached logo (`meditrack-logo.png`) into the header of every screen.

**Detailed requirements**  
- **App branding**  
  - Everywhere you say “app,” say “MediTrack.”  
  - Display the attached logo in the top-left corner of the UI.

- **Time override**  
  - Add a developer toggle or CLI flag `--currentTime="2025-05-08T14:30:00Z"` that forces `Date.now()` to that value.  
  - All reminder schedules, logs, and notifications must read from this overridden time when present.

- **Image processing**  
  - Replace the JS image-OCR library with a call to OpenAI’s Vision endpoint:  
    ```
    const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/images/analyze", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ image: base64Image })
    });
    ```  
  - Parse the JSON to extract `name`, `dosage`, and `frequency`.  
  - Show a full-width preview of the captured image and the AI’s extracted fields before saving.

- **Reminder testing**  
  - When time is overridden, schedule and fire notifications relative to `--currentTime`.  
  - Notifications must show “Snooze 10 min” and “Confirm taken.”  
  - Snoozing should reschedule based on the overridden clock.
